## 🧩 Abstract  
Petlink is an AI-driven web platform designed to facilitate intelligent pet matchmaking and community interaction among pet owners. Leveraging computer vision and AI-based classification, the system automatically detects pet breeds and allows owners to enrich profiles for improved matchmaking accuracy.  

This project explores the intersection of **AI**, **web accessibility**, and **user-centered design**, aiming to simplify pet networking through automation and intelligent recommendation.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  
1. To develop an intuitive digital platform that connects pet owners for breeding or companionship.  
2. To utilize AI for **automatic pet breed detection** and metadata extraction from uploaded images.  
3. To create an editable and flexible system where users can refine AI-generated details.  
4. To deploy a modern, responsive, and accessible interface using **Next.js** and **Vercel**.

## 🧠 Methodology  

### 1. Data Processing & AI Integration  
- An image recognition model is used to detect the **breed and key attributes** of the pet upon upload.  
- Results are editable by users to ensure accuracy and personalization.  
- AI inference is triggered client-side or via lightweight server functions.  

### 2. System Design  
- Built using **Next.js (TypeScript)** for structured, scalable development.  
- Modular architecture dividing logic into `/components`, `/hooks`, and `/lib`.  
- Deployed on **Vercel**, ensuring high availability and performance.  

### 3. User Interaction Flow  
1. User creates an account and uploads a pet image.  
2. The AI model predicts breed and metadata.  
3. The user verifies or edits the generated details.  
4. The profile becomes visible to others for potential pairing or networking.
